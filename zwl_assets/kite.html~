<h3>Aerial photo by a Kite</h3>

When I was in Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China, as a college students. My roomate and I developed interest in photography and flying kites. One day we come up with this idea that why don't we do this together? How about putting our mobile phone on the kite and take some photos?
<br>

We did this, got many wonderful photos and many funny things happened. It was a long journey and eventually got intense media cover all over China. Here I select some links (unfortunately all in Chinese, including my own menory note).
